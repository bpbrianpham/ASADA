		<h2><a name="about_asada">About ASADA</a></h2>

		<p>The Alexa anti-depression project is an idea by Dr. Eleazar Eskin in an attempt to help alleviate people suffering with depression. Alexa Support Anti Depression Application (ASADA) is an artificial intelligence application that is built using Node.js and Alexa Skills Kit. The main purpose of ASADA is to help users cope with struggling with depression and lower their depression levels by talking to Alexa on a daily basis.</p>

		<p>Depression is a mental disease that millions of people suffer from every year and the number of people affected by depression grow every year. In 2012, in the United States alone, the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 6.9 percent of the population has had at least one depression episode. This is approximately 16 million people and the numbers will only keep increasing as time goes by. In a broader perspective, a report from Columbia University shows that in 2015, the percentage of people affected by depression increased by 12.7 percent.</p>

		<p>The proposed project ASADA will listen to a speaking user provided that the user says the vocal command to trigger the application. Once the application has interpreted a user’s input, it will then respond with one of several responses that will attempt to converse with the user serving as an emotional outlet or pillar for the user. This allows the user to cope with his or her depression symptoms. ASADA will function as if the user is speaking to a therapist.</p>

		<p>The goal of ASADA is to help cope with the user’s depression in that it lets the user know someone cares enough to check up on them. This shall help lower the steadily increasing rates of depression that affect millions of people per year. The program matters because depression is increasing at a fast pace in America with yearly studies showing increasing numbers of those affected by depression. ASADA will serve as an emotional support pillar that aims to help lower/decrease severity of depression symptoms and provide social support to aid the user with their symptoms.</p>

		<h2><a name="getting_started">Getting Started</a></h2>
		<p>ASADA requires an Alexa-enabled device such as the Amazon Echo and a smartphone with the Android operating system installed with a version equal to or greater than 5.0. If you already have the two devices, all that is needed is for you to install the ASADA app from the Google Play Store. In addition, you are required to have an Amazon account as that is how user validation is done within the app. Currently, ASADA is not available for iOS devices.</p>
